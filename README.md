# Food App
As part of my application for the Olcademy Mobile App Developer Internship, I made this application user interface to showcase my mobile app design abilities.

Task:
```
Create a Mini Food Ordering Mobile App UI with Firebase

   - Review and adjust cart items.
   - View total price.
   - Order summary and submission.
#### Firebase
   - Firebase setup for project.
   - Manage menu items and orders using Firestore.
   - Real-time data fetching for up-to-date menu and prices.
   - Loading states and error handling for data fetching.
